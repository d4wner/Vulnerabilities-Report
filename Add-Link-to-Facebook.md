Well ,sir ,I just found a Stored-XSS bug here.

#### ADLab of Venustech


The report link to the wordpress-form is missing, because the manager do not wish to put the public in danger ,I'll just write some details here.


When I login into the wordpress panel, assume I have a low privilege role like a editor user.

```
http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/users.php
```

Because the admin user has turned on the option of the wp-plugin  Add-Link-to-Facebook, a normal user like me can also use it.

I can write something in the profile page.
By the way, I'm the user "test" now:

At the profile page:
```
http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/profile.php
```

But when I pentest the  parameter in this plugin, I found when I write something into this point, it does not filter well:


Weak post parameter:
```
al2fb_facebook_id='"><img src=x onerror=console.log(/xss_att_fackbookid/)><'"
```

When I use the user "admin" to edit the profile of the user "test", we can view the stored-xss.

```
http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/user-edit.php?user_id=2&wp_http_referer=%2Fwordpress%2Fwp-admin%2Fusers.php
```

I can get the manager's cookie easily, or do something more evilly.


Well,  by the way, I just test the bug in the wordpress 4.9.1 and the latest version of the wp-plugin Add-Link-to-Facebook.
